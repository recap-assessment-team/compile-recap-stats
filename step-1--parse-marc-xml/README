The first step is to parse the MARC XML from HTC dump and
put it into rectangular form for joining, easy filterings, etc..

For this, you can either tell me to run it for you (with or without
modification) or install SBCL, GNU coreutils,  all necessary packages,
clix (https://github.com/tonyfischetti/clix), etc...

Sorry, but I had to make this "fun" somehow


Unpack the HTC XML files into a directory and point
`parse-all-marcxmls.lisp` to that directory

For example, this is what I do...

````
./parse-all-marcxmls.lisp ~/data/htc/NYPL > ~/data/parsed-htc/NYPL-RECAP.dat
```

(and for the other partners)

Even though standard input is redirected, there are some helpful
diagnostic messages from STDERR.
